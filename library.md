- I will list multipule firestore collections , and I will specify the the strcture of the documents inside those, and how are they realted to each other:

  - contentTypes:
    - contentTypeName (string)
    - contentTypeIconName
    - isActive (boolean)
  - contentOwners:
    - ownerName (string)
    - ownerSource (string)
    - isActive (boolean)
  - contentCategories:
    - categoryName (string)
    - contentCategoryIconName
    - isActive (boolean)
  - content:
    - contentCategoryId (string)
    - contentLanguage (string)
    - contentLink (string)
    - contentName (string)
    - contentOwnerId (string)
    - contentTypeId (string)
    - createdAt(timestamp)
    - isActive (boolean)
    - isDeleted (boolean)
    - updatedAt (timestamp)
  - contentLists:
    - id (string)
    - contentListIconName
    - isActive (boolean)
    - isFeatured (boolean)
    - listContentIds (array)
    - listDescription (string)
    - listName (string)

- I need you to create a full slice (notifier/service/repository) considering the following requirements:

- The user should be able to get the latest 6 added contents.
- The user should be able to get the featured lists
- The user should be able to see all lists
- The user should be able to view the details of a list
- The user should be able to get all content types, and based on this information, the user can see all of the content related to this content type.
- The user should be able to search, based on a text, this should look in all realted details to contents and content lists so the returned values in this case a list of content and a list of content lists
